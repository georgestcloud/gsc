<b>As a data scientist with a passion for frontend development, I bring a unique blend of analytical skills and design sensibility to the table. I am proficient in Python, SQL, and machine learning. I utilize data to derive actionable insights. My skills go beyond data manipulation.
 <br> On the frontend, I leverage JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to develop media-responsive and interactive interfaces across all device types. I have hands-on experience with frameworks like React.js and PHP, which ensure smooth user interactions. My knowledge of Bootstrap enables me to design visually appealing and user-friendly online applications.<br>

My commitment to staying current with the latest technology, teamwork, and excellent problem-solving skills gained through research and experience make me a priceless asset for projects that require both analytical thinking and a polished user interface.<br></b>"}),e.jsx("div",{className:"btn-box",children:e.jsx(n,{to:a,target:"blank",children:"View My Resume"})})]})]})}));export{c as default};
